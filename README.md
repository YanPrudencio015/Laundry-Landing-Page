# Laundry Landing Page ðŸ§¼

A clean and responsive landing page for a fictional laundry service, originally designed for a real client who ended up not moving forward with the delivery. I used this opportunity to refine my skills in layout, responsiveness, and component organization.

## ðŸ§© Features

- Fully responsive layout using pure HTML and CSS
- Mobile-first approach
- Clear visual hierarchy and structured sections
- Hosted on Vercel

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was created for a real client in the laundry services niche. Although it was not delivered in production due to the client already having a website, I completed and improved the landing page to use as part of my portfolio.

It demonstrates my ability to build marketing pages from scratch using semantic HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles.
